    <p>I am from Albany, New York, and am currently studying at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute to become an Electrical Engineer.</p>
    <p>I have always been interested in electronics from a young age, since my father was an electrical/computer engineer, and he taught me a lot about the field.</p>
    <p>I have made a few projects, which will be seen on the projects page. I strive to learn more and more about the field of electronics, and I hope to one day start my own business.</p>
